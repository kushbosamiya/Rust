<!-- vectors -->
-------------------------------------------------------
- empty vectors  -> done
- macro vector : direct initialization -> done
- vector with ::capacity  -> done
- accessing the elements of the of the array  -> done
- usage of get to access  -> done
- how to modify the vectors -> done
- get the lenght and capacity of vector -> done
- vector slicing --> done
- -shrink to fit  -> to mainatain the capacity of the vectors
- extendfromslice  -> append child to og vector in to existing --> done 
- buffer-resize  -> done --> their for to resize the vector in which you need to specify the lenght and initial elements to add

<!-- hashmaps  -->
hashmaps define -> key value pairs , uses hash algoriths to store the value 
operations 
    - insert
    - update 
    - remove 
    - access
types of way to make the hashmaps
    - empty hashmaps 
    - preallocated hashmaps
    - direct initialization
